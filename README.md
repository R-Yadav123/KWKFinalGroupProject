Kode with Klossy Final Project - 2022

Mobile App Development IOS Single-App created in Xcode.
App Name: Pawsibilities

Here at Pawsibilities, we aim to encourage the majority of pet owners to measure their pet's (dog/cat) food accurately. 
In our app, as a group, we have created various pages including a launch/splash screen, homepage, create a pet profile, fun facts, and an about us
page.

We used skills that we learned to create a random generator as well as scroll-view with constraints. Furthermore, we included a photo library in which the user can select photos from their own library.
Utilizing various components such as textfields and a segmented control, as a group, we were able to successfully code a user-friendly app. 

Pawsibilities has many features and functionalities in which we coded in Swift (a computer programming language).
